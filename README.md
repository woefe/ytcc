# ytcc

Command line tool to keep track of your favorite playlists on YouTube and many other places.

**The second beta release of ytcc 2.0.0 is out!**
Read [the migration guide](#migrating-from-version-1) before upgrading to 2.0.0 or later!
If you are looking for older versions, check the [Release](https://github.com/woefe/ytcc/releases) page and the [v1 branch](https://github.com/woefe/ytcc/tree/v1).


## Installation
### From PyPI
```shell script
pip install ytcc
```

### Arch Linux
Install [ytcc-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ytcc-git/) from the AUR.
The [ytcc](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ytcc/) package will be upgraded to version 2.0.0, when it has a stable release.

### Without installation
You can start ytcc directly from the cloned repo, if all requirements are installed.

```shell script
./ytcc.py --help
```

Hard requirements:
- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/)
- [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/),
- [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)

Optional requirements:
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for youtube-dl's `.mp4` or `.mkv` merging
- [mpv](https://mpv.io/), if you want to play audio or video

## Migrating from version 1
Versions 2.0.0 and later are not compatible with previous databases and configuration files!
You need to follow several steps to migrate your subscriptions to 2.0.0 or later.
Unfortunately, videos migrated from version 1 always have the duration attribute set to zero.

*Note: If you adjusted the database location in version 1 you have to adjust the paths used below*

1. Upgrade ytcc to version 2.0.0 or later.
2. Download the migration script from [here](https://github.com/woefe/ytcc/tree/master/scripts/migrate.py).
3. Rename your v1 database.
    ```shell script
    mv ~/.local/share/ytcc/ytcc.db ~/.local/share/ytcc/ytcc.db.v1
    ```
4. Migrate the database.
    ```shell script
    python3 path/to/migrate.py --olddb ~/.local/share/ytcc/ytcc.db.v1 --newdb ~/.local/share/ytcc/ytcc.db
    ```
5. (Optional) Take a look at the [configuration](#configuration) to see what's new and update your config.

###Alternative migrations
####Channel export and import
1. Export your subscriptions with ytcc 1.8.5 **before** upgrading to 2.0.0 or later
    ```shell script
    ytcc --export-to subscriptions.opml
    ```
2. Upgrade ytcc
3. Rename configuration file and database (e.g. with `mv ~/.config/ytcc ~/.config/ytcc.1`)
4. Import your subscriptions with v2
    ```shell script
    ytcc import subscriptions.opml
    ```
5. (Optional) You might also want to adjust your config to the new format. See [Configuration](#configuration).

#### Start from scratch
If you think the procedures described above are not worth the effort, you can start from scratch by removing the `~/.config/ytcc` directory.


## Usage

"Subscribe" to playlists.
```shell script
ytcc subscribe "Jupiter Broadcasting" "https://www.youtube.com/user/jupiterbroadcasting"
ytcc subscribe "NCS: House" "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRBp0Fe2GpgmsW46rJyudVFlY6IYjFBIK"
```

Import subscriptions from YouTube's subscription manager export.
```shell script
ytcc import ~/Downloads/subscription_manager
```

Fetch metadata of new videos.
```shell script
ytcc update
```

List unwatched videos.
```shell script
ytcc list
```

List playlist content in JSON format.
```shell script
ytcc --output json list --playlist "NCS: House" --since 2020-07-07 --watched
```

Start the interactive terminal interface.
```shell script
ytcc tui
```

Mark all videos of a playlist as watched without playing them.
```shell script
ytcc ls -p "Jupiter Broadcasting" | ytcc mark
```

Listen to some music without limitations.
```shell script
ytcc ls -p "NCS: House" | ytcc play --audio-only
```

**Alternative terminal interface built on [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)**.
Requires fzf version 0.19.0 or newer, preferably after [6f9664d](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/commit/6f9663da62a84fcce8992c63dad8016f3107364d).
Otherwise, you might experience some issues.
Script is available [here](https://github.com/woefe/ytcc/tree/master/scripts/ytccf.sh).
```shell script
ytccf.sh

# Show help and key bindings
ytccf.sh --help
```

## Configuration
Ytcc searches for a configuration file at following locations:

1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ytcc/ytcc.conf`
2. `~/.config/ytcc/ytcc.conf`
3. `~/.ytcc.conf`

If no config file is found in these three locations, a default config file is created at `~/.config/ytcc/ytcc.conf`.

### Example config

```ini
[ytcc]

# Directory where downloads are saved, when --path is not given
download_dir = ~/Downloads

# Parameters passed to mpv. Adjusting these might break video playback in ytcc!
mpv_flags = --ytdl --ytdl-format=bestvideo[height<=?1080]+bestaudio/best

# Defines the order of video listings.
# Possible options: id, url, title, description, publish_date, watched, duration, extractor_hash,
# playlists. Every option must be suffixed with :desc or :asc for descending or ascending sort.
order_by = playlists:asc, publish_date:desc

# Default attributes shown in video listings.
# Some ytcc commands allow overriding the default set here in the config.
video_attrs = id, title, publish_date, duration, playlists

# Default attributes shown in playlist/subscription listings.
# Some ytcc commands allow overriding the default set here in the config.
playlist_attrs = name, url, tags

# Path where the database is stored.
# Can be used to sync the database between multiple machines.
db_path = ~/.local/share/ytcc/ytcc.db

# The format of used to print dates
date_format = %Y-%m-%d

# Default failure threshold before a video is ignored.
# When a video could not be updated repeatedly, it will be ignored by ytcc after `max_update_fail`
# attempts. This setting can be overridden with the --max-fail commandline parameter.
max_update_fail = 5

# Default update backlog.
# The update command will only the first `max_update_backlog` videos of a playlist to improve
# performance. This setting can be overridden with the --max-backlog commandline parameter.
max_update_backlog = 20

# Ignore videos that have an age limit higher than the one specified here.
age_limit = 0


# Prompt and table colors. Supports 256 colors. Hence, values between 0-255 are allowed.
# See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit for the color codes.

[youtube_dl]
merge_output_format = mkv
# Format (see FORMAT SELECTION in youtube-dl manpage). Make sure to use a video format here, if you
# want to be able to download videos.
format = bestvideo[height<=?1080]+bestaudio/best

# Output template (see OUTPUT TEMPLATE in youtube-dl manpage)
outputtemplate = %(title)s.%(ext)s

# If a merge is required according to format selection, merge to the given container format.
# One of mkv, mp4, ogg, webm, flv
mergeoutputformat = mkv

# Loglevel options: quiet, normal, verbose
loglevel = normal

# Limit download speed to the given bytes/second. Set 0 for no limit.
# E.g. limit to one megabyte per second
#ratelimit = 1000000
ratelimit = 0

# Set number of retries before giving up on a download.
# Set 0 for no retries.
retries = 0

# Subtitles for videos. If enabled and available, automatic and manual subtitles for selected
# languages are embedded in the video.
#subtitles = en,de
subtitles = off

# Embed the youtube thumbnail in audio downloads. Transforms the resulting file to m4a, if
# enabled.
thumbnail = on

# Skips livestreams in download command
skip_live_stream = true

## Reporting issues
Create a new issue on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/woefe/ytcc/issues/new).
Describe the issue as detailed as possible and please use the issue templates, if possible!
**Important**: do not forget to include the output of `ytcc bug-report` in bug reports.
It also might help a lot to run ytcc with the `--loglevel debug` option and include the output in your report.

## Development
We recommend developing inside a virtualenv.

1. Set up a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
2. Install development dependencies: `pip install -r devrequirements.txt`

Run the following commands before every pull request and fix the warnings or errors they produce.
```shell script
mypy ytcc
pytest
pylint ytcc
pydocstyle ytcc
```

<!--
## Translations
Ytcc uses the GNU gettext utilities to manage localization.

### Managing locales
Create a new locale with `msginit`. The example below creates a new locale for Polish.
```bash
cd po
msginit --locale pl
```

Every time the PO template is changed, the locales have to be updated with `msgmerge`.
```bash
cd po
msgmerge --update de.po ytcc.pot
```

Every time a PO file is created or updated, new strings have to be translated. There are multiple tools available, see
the [GNU gettext manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Editing). I prefer GTranslator, e.g:

```bash
cd po
gtranslator de.po
```

### Updating the PO tempate
```bash
xgettext --output=po/ytcc.pot \
    --language=Python \
    --from-code=utf-8 \
    --copyright-holder="Wolfgang Popp" \
    --package-name="ytcc" \
    --package-version=$(python -c "import ytcc; print(ytcc.__version__)") \
    ytcc/{cli,arguments}.py
```
